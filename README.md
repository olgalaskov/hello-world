# hello-world
Just another first repo
Hi, my name is Olga, I'm 24-year-old young researcher (or just MD who wants to believe) in Neuroscience. I'm living and working in Prague for last 8 years, but originally I'm from Russia. In the next year I'm planning to move to Israel. So now I'm mainly study Hebrew, doing stuff for my medicine license in Israel and going fcking crazy about that.
